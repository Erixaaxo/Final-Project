## Abstract

## Keywords

Kidz Bop, music, censorship, kids, cursing

## Introduction

Kidz Bop has been a popular kid singing group for years, covering popular songs and changing lyrics to make them kid-friendly. They have been around for many generations of childhoods and it is always fun hearing what popular songs they covered next. But it begs the questions: **Why do they censor certain lyrics? What gets censored the most? And does it bring harm that they censor so much of the song that it takes away the meaning? These questions are important as censorship has always been a heavy topic in the media, but Kidz Bop has never been questioned on their own censorship.**

## The Dataset

We found our data from the pudding dataset.
[Kidz Bop Dataset](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/kidz-bop)

The data was collected by Jan Diehm. She collected the data using the Genius API, Spotify API, R, as well as manual wrangling. The data was collected for the pudding arctile, ["Just how does Kidz Bop censor songs?"](https://pudding.cool/2020/04/kidz-bop/), which aims to highlight just what words are being censored, what they're replaced with, and what category of bad word they are. We will be focusing on two of the datasets within the project, KB_censored-lyrics (10 columns and 1354 rows) and KB_word-overview (5 columns and 227 rows).

## Challenges & Limitations

What challenges or limitations might you need to address with your project idea more broadly? Briefly discuss. (at least 150 words)

Though our topic is relatively light-hearted, in our project we would have to address the challenge of censorship. We have to ask what amount of censorship is the right amount? With too little censorship, the songs may have a negative influence on the child audience if they're constantly listening to songs about substance abuse or violence. However, with too much censorship, Kidz Bop may be keeping their audience too sheltered or closed-minded by censoring words such as "transgender" and "pray." In addition, our group would have to address the limitations of the dataset we have. We have no way of telling how or what criteria Kidz Bop censors the lyrics off of. Is it an algorithm, one person, or a whole team of people selecting which lyrics censor? What is their reasoning behind the censorship? Limitations in the data like that would prevent our group from accurately addressing the challenge of censorship.
