## Abstract

## Introduction
Kidz Bop has been a popular kid singing group that covers popular songs and censors them. They have been around for many years, and it is always fun in games hearing what they covered next. But it begs the questions: **Why do they censor lyrics? What gets censored the most? And does it bring harm that they censor so much of the song that it takes away the meaning? These questions are important as censorship has always been a heavy topic in the media, but Kidz Bop has never been in the question on their own censorship.**
