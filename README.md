## Abstract

## Keywords

Kidz Bop, music, censorship

## Introduction

Kidz Bop has been a popular kid singing group for years, covering popular songs and changing lyrics to make them kid-friendly. They have been around for many generations of childhoods and it is always fun hearing what popular songs they covered next. But it begs the questions: **Why do they censor certain lyrics? What gets censored the most? And does it bring harm that they censor so much of the song that it takes away the meaning? These questions are important as censorship has always been a heavy topic in the media, but Kidz Bop has never been questioned on their own censorship.**

## The Dataset

We found our data from the pudding dataset.
  [Kidz Bop Dataset](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/kidz-bop)

The data was collected by Jan Diehm. She collected the data using the Genius API, Spotify API, R, as well as manual wrangling. The data was collected for the pudding arctile, ["Just how does Kidz Bop censor songs?"](https://pudding.cool/2020/04/kidz-bop/), which aims to highlight just what words are being censored, what they're replaced with, and what category of bad word they are. We will be focusing on two of the datasets within the project, KB_censored-lyrics (10 columns and 1354 rows) and KB_word-overview (5 columns and 227 rows).
