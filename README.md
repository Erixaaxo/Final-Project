## Abstract

## Keywords

Kidz Bop, music, censorship

## Introduction

Kidz Bop has been a popular kid singing group for years, covering popular songs and changing lyrics to make them kid-friendly. They have been around for many generations of childhoods and it is always fun hearing what popular songs they covered next. But it begs the questions: **Why do they censor certain lyrics? What gets censored the most? And does it bring harm that they censor so much of the song that it takes away the meaning? These questions are important as censorship has always been a heavy topic in the media, but Kidz Bop has never been questioned on their own censorship.**
